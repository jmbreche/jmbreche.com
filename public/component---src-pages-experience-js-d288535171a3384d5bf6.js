The CareShare platform, which I was instrumental in developing, helps employers set and monitor benefits for their employees. It is not a pool of funds, but rather a commitment to cover a predetermined amount of employee's health costs. The platform makes it easy for employees to identify themselves and receive treatment, increasing utilization when compared to traditional insurance. Employers also receive alerts when an invoice is available, and they can quickly pay off their balance from the CareShare home page, allowing them to focus on their business."),n.createElement(i,{title:"Do College Better"},"I have a wealth of experience in helping students excel in their studies, particularly in statistical and data analysis techniques, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

I have a track record of effectively communicating with students and providing them with personalized feedback and guidance, which helps them to achieve their goals.
